# EventOrganization

## About project

This is a learning project in which we tried to implement an application for organizing events.
There are 3 types of users in the project: *standard, creator, administrator*.
Each of them has different possibilities to interact with the application, but to try the functionality **you need to login or register**. For example, a **standard** user can only view and add events for themselves, while a **creator** can create events for others. You can start a project according to the instructions below and try to use it



## List of technologies and libraries

The following technologies were used in the application:
* [Custom backend](https://github.com/ChityaVerepanov/events-back), which was created manually
* Material Design icons
* RxJS
* TS / JS
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
